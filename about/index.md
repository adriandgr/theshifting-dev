## WE DO NOT HAVE A MANIFESTO.

The apprehension that binds and prevents us from penning a manifesto is rooted in a deeper aversion to the inaccurate representation of the wide range of aesthetics being pursued within our artist collective.

Having realized this, we outgrew our manifesto-seeking anxieties that paralyzed us, and embraced a new understanding of what a group of artists should direct their focus on: something beyond our own personal thoughts and projects. Ours is a community full of debate and misunderstanding, but also a space where we can learn from each other. It is a zone of exchange, a school of sorts.

We enter our project Transformations as ‘raw’ items and evolve, growing to become a ‘refined’ product of this endeavor. It goes beyond our mere individual selves, for other identities and entities can enter and depart from it regardless of the presence of the original founders.

That is aesthetic, that is beauty.

## WE ARE A COLLECTIVE

As a group of ‘Emerging Artists,’ we are able to define ‘new art’ in our current moment. However, new artists are constantly emerging to replace the old, and so we find ourselves in a temporal position that, while allocating vitality to our work, is much too precarious to rely on for sustained existence as artists. While we are unable to occupy this position in a state of eternal youth, what we can do is take these experiences and thoughts and crystallize them into something that takes up space. With these objects, we work with the idea of transformation, in order to establish relationships within the communities we create and incorporate them into our own development.

From these transformations, we can begin to assess our own situation in this movement: a movement that we are both defining for ourselves, and being swept into at the same time.

## OUR PROJECT – TRANSFORMATIONS

‘Raw,’ ‘Processed,’ ‘Refined.’ How do we associate with these words, and what is the weight they carry for us?

When trying to turn our ideas into statements, it becomes important to consider what we include & exclude in discourse and definitions. Coming from academia inherently skews our perspective, but this is an important incentive for us to work towards accessibility and integration into the art world outside of the classroom. Does this mean that we leave behind everything we have taken on from the classroom? Of course not; but art about process, and more importantly, progress, needs this kind of self-reflexivity in order to extend its reach outside of the ivory tower. This is also why we want to expand and open our collective to all artists, auto-didactic, academic or technical.

Beyond our own selves, the space in which we both create and display our art needs to evolve as well. With an emphasis on creating our own domains away from the university, it seems fitting that this process begins in the home. What can be more ‘raw’ than to expose the domestic to the public? Walking in through the back door, to be met not only by art, but kitchens and furniture and books, creates a different type of relationship with the viewer and the artist(s) than that typically expected in a fine art gallery. Neither relationship is inherently superior, but exploring the significance of each, as well as spaces where the line between this binary blurs, is an important distinction for us.

In the end, though, we are ultimately placing ourselves in a position of intersectionality. Not only in the sense of our own identities, but in the fact that we are making these steps into gallery spaces as a group. Individual identity is forfeited for something more collective, and our own transformations become a slurry of discourse and collaboration. It is in this type of existence that we can explore transformation as something beyond the conventions of linear progression. From a raw material, it becomes possible to change outwards, backwards, hierarchically, but also rhizomatically. Material relationships become more complex as they emerge from these different directions of ‘progress,’ and it is from these relationships that we derive a foundation for our own art.
