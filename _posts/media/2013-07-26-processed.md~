## OUR PROJECT – TRANSFORMATIONS

‘Raw,’ ‘Processed,’ ‘Refined.’ How do we associate with these words, and what is the weight they carry for us?

When trying to turn our ideas into statements, it becomes important to consider what we include & exclude in discourse and definitions. Coming from academia inherently skews our perspective, but this is an important incentive for us to work towards accessibility and integration into the art world outside of the classroom. Does this mean that we leave behind everything we have taken on from the classroom? Of course not; but art about process, and more importantly, progress, needs this kind of self-reflexivity in order to extend its reach outside of the ivory tower. This is also why we want to expand and open our collective to all artists, auto-didactic, academic or technical.

Beyond our own selves, the space in which we both create and display our art needs to evolve as well. With an emphasis on creating our own domains away from the university, it seems fitting that this process begins in the home. What can be more ‘raw’ than to expose the domestic to the public? Walking in through the back door, to be met not only by art, but kitchens and furniture and books, creates a different type of relationship with the viewer and the artist(s) than that typically expected in a fine art gallery. Neither relationship is inherently superior, but exploring the significance of each, as well as spaces where the line between this binary blurs, is an important distinction for us.

In the end, though, we are ultimately placing ourselves in a position of intersectionality. Not only in the sense of our own identities, but in the fact that we are making these steps into gallery spaces as a group. Individual identity is forfeited for something more collective, and our own transformations become a slurry of discourse and collaboration. It is in this type of existence that we can explore transformation as something beyond the conventions of linear progression. From a raw material, it becomes possible to change outwards, backwards, hierarchically, but also rhizomatically. Material relationships become more complex as they emerge from these different directions of ‘progress,’ and it is from these relationships that we derive a foundation for our own art.
